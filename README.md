# Dictionary 
***
Saw [this challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL) on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and thought it looked pretty cool. I decided to use it as another step in my practice with **Typescript**.


I also took the route I don't usually take - use **Sass** instead of **Tailwind**.

## Tech I used
- React + Typescript
- Sass
